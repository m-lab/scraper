#!/bin/bash

# prepare-commit-msg is a shell script that gets called by git with the temp
# filename of the future commit message as its first argument. Its purpose is
# to edit that file in order to make the commit message better/more complete.
#
# It runs code coverage and runs the linter and a bunch of formatters over the
# code, and then appends the output of those tools as comments at the bottom of
# the commit message.  However, it can also be run without a command-line
# argument, just in case you want to see what its output is going to be without
# running "git commit". In that case, we do the same things, but we don't
# append anything to a file.
#
# To make git run this script, softlink this file into the .git/hooks
# directory.  The following command will get that done:
#   ln -s ../../prepare-commit-msg .git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg
#
# This module does not run the tests, it just outputs the saved information
# from past test runs. This is okay for the github flow because the tests are
# run in pre-commit, but users of this script in standalone mode should be
# aware that if they don't re-run the unit tests then the coverage stats will
# never change.
